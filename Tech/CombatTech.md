>### Nail dash resets
>This is your bread and butter of combat tech. You should be doing this anywhere and everywhere you can, from Lace 1 to GMS.  
>By taking advantage of both dash resetting your nail cooldown, and air dashes being refreshed upon landing, you can very quickly  
>Jump > Nail > Dash > Nail > ... Repeat  
>To essentially double your DPS compared to normal combat.

>### Pogo dash slash
>Further improving on [pogo dashing through enemies](/Movement/GeneralMovement.md#pogo--clawline-dashing-through-enemies) you can add an additional nail slash afterwards on some enemies, to take advantage of repositioning whilst still dealing damage.  
>Jump > Pogo > Dash > Turnaround + Nail  
>![Widow pogo dash slash](/Gifs/Combat%20Tech/pogo-dash-slash.gif)

>### Clawline Combos
>Used very rarely, but good in specific situations such as a barbed run (where clawline if buffed by [barbed bracelet](https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Barbed_Bracelet)) or during Lace 2's fight on her stagger and scream.  
>Clawline > Down Dash > Nail > ... Repeat  
>![Lace Clawline Combo](/Gifs/Combat%20Tech/clawline-combo.gif)

>### Landing Spears
>By using spear as soon as you land you can cut off part of the spear and nail animation. The timing is difficult to get used to, but is perfect for all combat situations in order to kill bosses quickly.  
>![Landing spear](/Gifs/Combat%20Tech/landing-spear.gif)  
>![Landing spear 2](/Gifs/Combat%20Tech/lanfing-spear-2.gif)

>### Turn-around Spears
>By using the spear during the turnaround animation you can cut off part of the spear animation. The timing is difficult to get used to, but is perfect for all combat situations in order to kill bosses quickly.  
>Push the opposite direction you want to spear > Push the direction you want to spear > Spear  
>![Turn-around spear](/Gifs/Combat%20Tech/turn-around-spear.gif)  
>![Turn-around spear 2](/Gifs/Combat%20Tech/turn-around-spear-2.gif)

>### Wall cancel Spears
>By using your spear to hit both an enemy and the wall behind it, you can cut off a LARGE portion of the spear animation. One of the easiest tricks to do, and perfect for many combat situations such as boss arenas.  
>![Wall cancel spear](/Gifs/Combat%20Tech/wall-cancel-spear.gif)

>### Dash attack spear
>By buffering a spear input ouf of a dash attack, you can skip some of the animation of spearing, perfect for combat everywhere.  
> This one can be difficult, as you need to have good spacing to the enemy you want to hit. Too close and you get sent flying upwards, too far away and your attack misses completely.  
>Additionally people have said going neutral (not using any movement inputs) helps to get this trick more consistent.
>![Dash attack spear](/Gifs/Combat%20Tech/dash-attack-spear.gif)

>### Pogo Spears
>By pogo-ing an enemy, and instantly using silkspear, you can cut off some of the animation. Not used as often, but useful for certain situations.  
>![Pogo spear](/Gifs/Combat%20Tech/pogo-spear.gif)

> ### Sawtooth turn-arounds
>Fixed in 1.0.28891  
>Sawtooth circlet has two hitboxes. One in front of the player and one behind. In patches 28714 and below, it's possible to hit enemies with both sides of sawtooth by facing away from the enemy and -  
>Jumping > Cloak > Face towards enemy + nail  
>Dealing HUGE amounts of damage in a very short time frame.  
>![Sawtooth turn-around](/Gifs/Combat%20Tech/sawtooth-turn-arounds.gif)

>### Flea Brew
>Using flea brew allows you to swing your nail faster to increase your DPS. Simple as that.  
>The timing of your brew matters a lot, as it does not save significant time in most fights. However when used during downtime such as a phase transition, or a door opening, it will increase your overall DPS.
