# Any % Routes

A collection of the Any % Routes, with an explanation of their differences, and links to their splits and full notes.

- ### [Any% NMG](#any-no-major-glitches) (in order of fastest to slowest)
    - [RP Key route](#key-route)
    - [RP Flea route](#flea-route)
    - [LP Bells](#bell-route)
    - [LP Mist](#mist-route-with-cloak)
- ### [Any% AG](#any--all-glitches)

## Any% No Major Glitches
There are a few different routes for any% NMG. The Main differences:
- Cloak / Cloakless
- Bell route (Last Judge) / Mist route (Phantom)

Cloakless runs are faster than the cloak routes below, but require running on **Release Patch (1.0.28324)** In order to take advantage of a particular walljump in the underworks, only available on release patch.   
These runs go through the mist saving time from better routing not having to collect bells, skipping drifter's cloak, and skip certain bosses.  

### Key route
- Key route is fastest of all any% NMG routes (~1 minute faster than LP bell route as reference) gets 500 rosaries during the movement to and from bell beast, to buy a simple key in Bone Bottom, then goes through Wormways to get to Shellwood.

> No video guide as of yet, however watching the top runs on [SRC](https://www.speedrun.com/silksong?h=any-no-major-glitches-release-patch&x=zd39j4nd-ylq4yvzn.qzne828q-rn1kmmvl.10vzvmol) can help a lot with understanding the route.

### Flea route
- Flea route is ~~cutest~~ slower than key, but was originally more popular. Collects five fleas and uses the flea caravan to get to Greymoor without cloak. Notably flea route has to fight Lace while key does not, in order to get a flea located in far fields.

> [!NOTE]  
> Technically you can do a cloakless run on later patches by using the reaper crest pogo. However it is slow to collect reapers crest.

### The below cloak routes are run on later patches of the game, and get Drifters Cloak. The early game is the same up to Greymor, then have two routes to get to Citadel:


### Bell Route
- This is by far the most popular route, due to it being fairly beginner friendly and a great entry point for speedrunning. Bells gets 5 bells, fights The Last Judge to go through the Grand Gate for act 2. It's ~20 seconds faster than a cloak mist due to some tricky skips in Blasted Steps, and a craw pogo to Greymoor bell. There are easier alternatives to these skips, however by doing the slower easier version, you lose the 20 second time save this route has over a Cloaked Mist. This route without the skips may be the easiest for beginners, and is good practice if you want to add the skips in later.

> ![NOTE]
> The bell route is currently most optimal on patch **1.0.29242** in order to use of the nail upgrade cutscene skip, while still taking advantage of Lace 2's broken hitboxes during her fight. 

### Mist route (with cloak)
- This was the original any% route when speedrunning first started; Multiple routes could be considered "The Mist route" as they go through Sinners Road for The Mist, and fights Phantom to enter act 2. Specifically a mist route with cloak, is slower than bells and has the difficulty of The Mist itself, which can be quite punishing and can lead to random time loss, but doesn't have any difficult skips. Picking up and using Barbed Bracelet is *potentially* faster for mist route, but is even more punishing, and is still estimated to be slower than bell route. This route is good however if you don't like doing the bells route skips, you particularly like The Mist/Phantom, or want to practice for a cloakless run.

## Any % All Glitches

The All Glitches run has 2 main routes, one covered in the guide below (with a couple of diverging paths, in order to avoid particularly difficult sets of rooms) highly recommended for new runners; and another which uses some movement from [Low % AG](/Routes/Low%25Routes.md#low--all-glitches) routing. Both are ran on versions **1.0.28561**, **1.0.28650**, and **1.0.28714** of the game to take advantage of glitches such as :
- [Main Menu Storage](/Glitches/MajorGlitches.md#main-menu-storage-mms) (AKA MMS)
- (A LOT of) [Room Duping](/Glitches/MajorGlitches.md#room-duping)
- [Noclip](/Glitches/MajorGlitches.md#room-duping)

  > Unfortunately there isn't any form of guide on this specific route at this time, however take note of the differences between Any% AG runs and [Low% AG runs](/Routes/Low%25Routes.md#low--ag-routes) as they are VERY similar.
