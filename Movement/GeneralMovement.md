> ### Walking
>I mean... do I need to explain walking? It's slow, don't walk, speedrun.

>### Air pogos
>
>Pogo-ing in the air will move Hornet in the faced direction faster than walking. This means by inputting  
>High Jump > Down pogo > High Jump > Down pogo > ... Repeat. You move faster than walking.

>### Neutral Pogo's / Pogo NILs / Pogo Lag canceling
>
>Further improving on Air pogo's - By pogo-ing **without** a full jump and purposefully hitting the floor, you would usually be temporarily stunned. However, by going neutral (hence the name of this tech) by not inputting any left or right movement when hitting the floor, you remove the stun completely and can move again, to setup for another pogo, go neutral and repeat.  
Jump > Pogo > Release movement input (at any point during your pogo) > Repress movement input after landing > ... Repeat

>### Sprinting / Dashing
>Self explanatory. Get swift step and start running. Faster than walking, faster than neutral pogos, but slower than the movement below.

>### Jump dashing
>The initial boost from using swift step is faster than the rest of swift steps' movement, and so by starting a dash as often as possible, you get more speed than simply holding a dash. This works due to the fact an air dash cooldown is refreshed upon touching the floor. So by repeatedly dashing in the air and landing as fast as possible, you can take advantage of constantly refreshing dash, and the initial boost it gives.
>The timing for this tech can feel awkward due to how tight the window for perfect jump dashing is.  
>Some people find it to be easier if you simply input jump and dash at the same time, rather than delaying your dash.  
> Jump > Dash > Jump > Dash > ... Repeat. Or -  
> Jump + Dash > Jump + Dash > ... Repeat.  
>![Jump Dashing](/Media/Gifs/General%20Movement/jump-dashing.gif)

>### Pogo Dashing / Dive dashing / Wave dashing
>This is THE MAIN form of movement any non-silkspeed anklet runner will use.  
>Faster than Jump dashing, by combining both the speed a pogo gives you, as well as the initial dash boost, you can move INCREDIBLY fast throughout Pharloom.  
Hold Dash > Jump > Release Dash > Pogo > ... Repeat

>### Pogo / Clawline Dashing through enemies
>Additionally when pogo-ing, or using clawline on an enemy, the game gives you some invincibility frames, you can take advantage of this, and travel THROUGH large enemies by dashing just after.  
>Jump > Pogo > Immediate dash > Continue normal movement  
>![Pogo Through Enemies](/Media/Gifs/General%20Movement/pogo-dash-through.gif)  
>Or  
>Clawline > Dash > Continue normal movement

>### Clawline Pogo Dashing
>Useful for covering large flat ground areas, but fairly niche in use cases, not often recommended as you want to save your silk for combat, and slow if done incorrectly.
>Simply adding a Clawline at the end of a pogo dash, and continuing pogo dash as your Clawline ends, is ever so slightly faster than pogo dashing without it.
>
>When relying on your silk regenerating.  
>Clawline > Dash > 3 Pogo dashes > ... Repeat  
>![Clawline Regen dashing](/Media/Gifs/General%20Movement/clawline-regen-dash.gif)  
>Or if you have full silk -  
>Clawline > Pogo Dash (or just dash depending on preference) ... Repeat with a following Clawline if you have silk, or continue to pogo dash regularly.

>### Dash Attack Dashing
>Technically, this is one of the fastest forms of movement across flat ground. (Still slightly slower than pogo-dashing overall, but useful in some situations)
>However, it is not easy to get the inputs perfect, which ends up losing a lot of distance and time.
>
> Hold Dash > Attack > Release Dash > Small Pause > ... Repeat.

>### Flea Brew
>Simply using flea brew makes you run faster. That's it.  
>It should be noted that using the brew does stop you from moving temporarily as the animation plays, meaning it's best used during a moment you are forced to wait anyway - Such as when a door is opening, or you need to hit a specific timing in a cycle-based room.  
>Timing your flea brew uses is important depending on the use case.  
>![Flea Brew](/Media/Gifs/General%20Movement/flea-brew.gif)

>### Silkspeed Anklets
>Simply equipping Silkspeed Anklets and sprinting while you have silk is the easiest and fastest form of gaining speed, especially on flat ground.  
> Once you run out of silk, however, you will go back to normal speed until regaining silk again.

>### Bind Dash Refresh (Minor Glitch)
>Patched as of 1.0.28891.  
>Usually in patches 1.0.28714 and below, when in the air, Hornet will be allowed to dash once, and then needs to land again in order to refresh her dash.
>However, by binding in the air, and dashing at the time just as the bind finishes (usually people find it easier to spam the dash inout rather than time it), you're able to gain another in-air dash.
