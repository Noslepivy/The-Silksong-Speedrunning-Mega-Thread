> ### Walking
>I mean... do i need to explain walking? It's slow, don't walk, speedrun.
>

>### Air pogos
>
>Pogo-ing in the air will move hornet in the faced direction faster than walking. This means by inputting  
>High Jump > Down pogo > High Jump > Down pogo > ... Repeat. You move faster than walking.

>### Neutral Pogo's / Pogo NILs / Pogo Lag canceling
>
>Further improving on Air pogo's - By pogo-ing **without** a full jump and purposefully hitting the floor, you would usually be temporarily stunned. However by going neutral (hence the name of this tech) by not inputting any left or right movement when hitting the floor, you remove the stun completely and can move again, to setup for another pogo, go neutral and repeat.  
Jump > Pogo > Release Movement input (at any point during your pogo) > Repress movement keys after landing > ... Repeat

>### Sprinting / Dashing
>Self explanatory. Get swift step and start running. Faster than walking, faster than neutral pogos, but slower than the movement below.

>### Jump dashing
>The initial boost from using swift step is faster than the rest of swift steps' movement, and so by starting a dash as often as possible, you get more speed than simply holding a dash. We do this by jumping and dashing directly after, so we get the full boost from the dash start, and no slowdown since we're in the air.
>The timing for this tech can feel awkward due to how tight the window for perfect Jump dashing is.  
>Some people find it to be easier if you simply input jump and dash at the same time, rather than delaying your dash.  
> Jump > Dash > Jump > Dash > ... Repeat. Or -  
> Jump + Dash > Jump + Dash > ... Repeat.

>### Pogo Dashing / Dive dashing / Wave dashing
>This is THE MAIN form of movement any non-silkspeed anklet runner will use.  
>Faster than Jump dashing, by combining both the speed a pogo gives you, as well as the initial dash boost, you can move INCREDIBLY fast throughout Pharloom.  
Hold Dash > Jump > Release Dash > Pogo > ... Repeat

>### Clawline Pogo Dashing
>Useful for covering large flat ground areas, but fairly niche in use cases, not often recommended as you want to save your silk for combat, and slow if done incorrectly.
>Simply adding a Clawline at the end of a pogo dash, and continuing pogo dash as your Clawline ends is ever so slightly faster than pogo dashing without it.
>
>Hold Dash > Jump > Release Dash > Pogo > Clawline > Pogo > Dash ... Repeat with a following Clawline if you have silk, or continue to pogo dash regularly.

>### Dash Attack Dashing
>Technically this is one of the fastest forms of movement across flat ground (faster than pogo dashing if done frame perfectly)  
>However, it is not easy to get the inputs perfect, which ends up losing a lot of distance and time, making Pogo Dashing more popular.
>
> Hold Dash > Attack > Release Dash > Small Pause > ... Repeat.

>### Flea Brew
>Simply using flea brew makes you run faster. That's it.  
>It should be noted using the brew does stop you from moving temporarily as the animation plays, meaning it's best used during a moment you are forced to wait anyway - Such as when a door is opening, or you need to hit a specific timing in a cycle based room.  
>Timing your flea brew uses are important depending on use case.

>### Silkspeed Anklets
>Simply equipping Silkspeed Anklets and sprinting while you have silk is the easiest and fastest form of gaining speed, especially on flat ground.  
> Once you run out of silk however you will go back to normal speed, until regaining silk again.
